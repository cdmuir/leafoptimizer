## Optimize leaf traits to different environments *in silico*

**Caveat emptor** The current version of this package is very preliminary and undergoing active development. I encourage interested users to try it and give me feedback, but inspect results very closely and check back soon for updates. Also, it is very slow at the moment, but I will be working on speed once I can assure the results are reliable.
